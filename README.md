# Recent Changes to ACM Bot(2023-07-08T22:06:35.730Z)
## Less Redundant Code
Commands now follow [this style](https://github.com/roefinoavrililo/Discord.JS-Leveling-Bot/blob/master/commands/help.js)
Before, my code was conditionally checking everything in the index file
## Slash Command Improvements
Slash commands have also been remade and restructured, typing in `/` will show you some more commands that this bot can use. I've made it so commands can have subcommands instead of a jumble of options. The `/help` slash command now is more useful, allowing you to search info on a specific command. Commands now also have a short cooldown time.
## Future Improvements Plan
Before this summer ends, I would like get these all either set up or finished being set up:
	1. Finish reworking the slash commands
	2. Add in an XP leveling system, as well as a way to potentially reward club members with XP or something for attending ACM club events.
	3. Add in some other commands too. One such command being a way to automatically sign into a club event with one quick command, but maybe that will be at a later point in time. Another command I have in mind is to be able to create rolemenu's.
## Website Dashboard
Maybe at some point in the future, I would like to get a website dashboard setup for this bot. Maybe not. Who knows? Sure would be nice.
## Other stuff
If you have any feedback of improvements or additions that can be made to this bot, either run `/suggest bot` and input a suggestion via that box, it will go directly to me (appsro#0) in my support/testing server I set up for this bot, or you can just DM/mention me.
